# Mathematica

a library for maths implemented in Java. 

This library provides a variety of tools related to Mathematics, especially when it comes to Linear Algebra, where the project is full of functions for manipulating matrices, by implementing some well known alorithms.

It has also some functions that help in signal processing such as conv and fft. 

Note that this project is still in progress, so every function could potentially have some bugs.
